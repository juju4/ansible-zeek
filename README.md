## Continuous integration

This role has a travis basic test (for github), more advanced with kitchen and also a Vagrantfile (test/vagrant).

Once you ensured all necessary roles are present, You can test with:
```
$ cd /path/to/roles/juju.zeek
$ kitchen verify
$ kitchen login
$ KITCHEN_YAML=".kitchen.vagrant.yml" kitchen verify
```
or
```
$ cd /path/to/roles/juju4.zeek/test/vagrant
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
```
or
```
$ pip install molecule docker
$ molecule test
$ MOLECULE_DISTRO=ubuntu:18.04 molecule test --destroy=never
```

## Troubleshooting & Known issues

* At May 2016, kitchen tests are validated. Travis still have issues (Read-only filesystem. Huh?) and some ansible variable (ansible_default_ipv4) not set
* role is not idempotent, mostly broctl
* "Error bro: capstats failed (Host 127.0.0.1 is not alive)" (/opt/bro/logs/stats/stats.log)
* Monit: bro_rc and bro process falls in "Not monitored" state so no automatic restart
* For packages provided by opensuse, ensure your distribution is supported by checking [opensuse repo](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security:/zeek/). At Feb 2022, Centos 8 stream is no longer supported
